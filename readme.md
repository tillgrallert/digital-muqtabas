Development of this edition has moved to [github.com/openarabicpe/journal_al-muqtabas](https://github.com/openarabicpe/journal_al-muqtabas) to reflect the development of the project over the course of the last six years. At the same time, I have changed the folder structure to comply with the standards adopted for all editions within the framework of "Open Arabic Periodical Editions". This repository, therefore, acts as a placeholder and provides some redirects.
